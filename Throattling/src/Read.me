14 Important and widely used design Patterns to follow :



𝟭. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗛𝗼𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: used to optimize webpage loading time. It stores static content (information that doesn't change often, like an author's bio or an MP3 file) separately from dynamic content (like stock prices).

𝟮. 𝗣𝗲𝗲𝗿-𝘁𝗼-𝗣𝗲𝗲𝗿: Involves multiple components called Peers, where a pear may function both as a client, requesting services from other peers, and as a server, providing services to other peers.

𝟯. 𝗣𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗶𝘀𝗵𝗲𝗿-𝗦𝘂𝗯𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗯𝗲𝗿: Used to send (publishes) relevant messages to places that have subscribed to a topic.

𝟰. 𝗦𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻 – Used to partition data in a database to speed commands or queries.

𝟱. 𝗖𝗶𝗿𝗰𝘂𝗶𝘁 𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿: Helps make systems more fault tolerant by minimizing the effects of a hazard by rerouting traffic to another service.

𝟲. 𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻: Generally used to develop applications that include groups of subtasks that execute in a specific order.

𝟳. 𝗖𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁-𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿: A peer-to-peer architecture that is comprised of a client, which requests a service, and a server, which provides the service.

𝟴. 𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿-𝗦𝗹𝗮𝘃𝗲: Consists of two components; the master distributes the work among identical slaves and computes a final result from the results which the slaves return.

𝟵. 𝗣𝗶𝗽𝗲-𝗙𝗶𝗹𝘁𝗲𝗿: Used to structure systems that produce and process a stream of data.

𝟭𝟬. 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁-𝗗𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻: Uses events to trigger and communicate between decoupled services.

𝟭𝟭. 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹-𝗩𝗶𝗲𝘄-𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿: Divides an application into three components. The model contains the application's data and main functionality; the view displays data and interacts with the user; and the controller handles user input and acts as the mediator between the model and the view.

𝟭𝟮. Throttling - pattern controls how fast data flows into a target. It's often used to prevent failure during a distributed denial of service attack or to manage cloud infrastructure costs..

𝟭𝟯. 𝗠𝗶𝗰𝗿𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀: Used to create multiple services that work interdependently to create a larger application.

𝟭𝟰. 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗦𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Used to separate read and write activities to provide greater stability, scalability, and performance.
